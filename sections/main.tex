\section*{Abstract}
This paper introduces a theoretical structure named the Constructive Inverse Learning Structure, designed to enhance adaptive intelligence by learning from absent, inverse, or counterfactual patterns.

\section{Definition}
We define inverse learning as the capacity of a model to utilize information from what is not present or explicitly negated in its dataset. The structure leverages contrastive and reflective logic models.

\section{Application}
Applications span cognitive robotics, adversarial learning, and generative modeling.
